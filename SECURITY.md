## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting flow:

1. Open the repository Security tab.
2. Click "Report a vulnerability".
3. Provide reproduction details, impact, and any known mitigations.

If private reporting is unavailable, contact the maintainers through your internal security channel and include:

- Affected file paths and manifest names.
- Proof-of-concept or exploit steps.
- Suggested remediation, if available.

## Response Expectations

- Initial triage response target: 3 business days.
- Critical issues are prioritized for immediate mitigation and patch release.
